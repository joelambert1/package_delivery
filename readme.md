This is a mock package delivery program using a version of
'nearest neighbor' greedy algorithm.
This program reads a csv file containing distance data and a csv file containing package data and figures out how to deliver them


Assumptions:

•   Each truck can carry a maximum of 16 packages, with unique IDs.

•   The trucks travel at an average speed of 18 mph and gas/delivery/load time is factored

•   Three trucks and two drivers are available for deliveries.

•   There is up to one special note associated with a package. Delayed, only on truck 2, etc

•   The delivery address for package #9, is wrong and will be corrected at 10:20 a.m. will be updated at 10:20 a.m.
     (410 S State St, 84111)

•   Drivers leave the hub no earlier than 8:00 a.m.

•   The distances provided in the Distance Table are equal regardless of the direction traveled.
