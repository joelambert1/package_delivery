This project is a mock package delivery program using a
'nearest neighbor' greedy algorithm.

Assumptions:
•   Each truck can carry a maximum of 16 packages, and the ID number of each package is unique.
•   The trucks travel at an average speed of 18 mph and gas is factored
•   Three trucks and two drivers are available for deliveries.
•   Drivers leave the hub no earlier than 8:00 a.m.
•   The delivery and loading times are factored into the calculation of the average speed of the trucks.
•   There is up to one special note associated with a package. Delayed, only on truck 2, etc
•   The delivery address for package #9, is wrong and will be corrected at 10:20 a.m. will be updated at 10:20 a.m.
     (410 S State St, 84111)
•   The distances provided in the Distance Table are equal regardless of the direction traveled.
